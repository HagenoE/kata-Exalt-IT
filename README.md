## Can I go

Before lauching the node server, you must add a .env file. The easiest way is to transform the .env.exemple file into .env. Once the added, you need to put the correct value on the file.

After you need to do an "nvm use" and "nvm install" for have the node version in .nvmrc file.
Run the command line "npm i" for install all dependencies need for the API.

You could now do "npm start" or "node app.js".
